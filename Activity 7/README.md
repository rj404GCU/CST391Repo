The music application now has the added functionality of updating an creating album or editing it.  It keeps track of what's being typed in the form using React state hooks called useState. When the form is submitted, it puts together an album object from what was typed in and sends it off with a POST request to /albums if it's a new album, or a PUT request if it's an one that's being edited. The component also has handlers for canceling and updating the form. The form itself shows input fields for album details and buttons to cancel or submit it.
